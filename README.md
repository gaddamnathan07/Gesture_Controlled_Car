# Gesture_Controlled_Car
Gesture-controlled car using Arduino Nano, MPU6050 sensor, nRF modules, and L298N driver for real-time control via hand gestures. Processes motion data for precise movements like forward, backward, and rotation. Combines motion sensing and wireless communication for robotics and interactive applications.
